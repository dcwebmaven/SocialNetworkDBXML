# SocialNetworkDBXML
This is the final project for my XML course, and is designed to be a Personal Information Manager (PIM).

Here are the specifications for this project:

Personal Information Manager (PIM)

Throughout the course lessons, you learned how to use XML and XSL to create meaningful applications. Now you're ready to create your final XML application of: a personal information manager, or PIM.
A PIM keeps track of your contact information in an clear, manageable format. Typical entries include:

First Name,
Last Name,
Home Phone,
Work Phone,
Cell Phone,
Address,
Email Address

Depending on your data, there may be many more or slightly different entries. For your final project, you'll define a format for your PIM information to be stored in XML. You'll create XSL documents to translate your source XML into HTML, and create a schema.

Storing the Data in XML

The first task at hand is to define how your information will be stored. Your project will need to contain at least seven defined elements and three attributes. Start the project by defining your schema. Your schema must be as specific as possible to strictly enforce your specifications. Be sure to use appropriate data types.
It's up to you to define your own XML markup for your PIM. Make sure your tags can be understood clearly by others! Also, be sure to validate your XML document against your schema—you don't want to turn in an invalid XML phonebook!

Output to HTML

If you maintain your own website, you'll find this part of the final project especially useful. You're going to use your knowledge of HTML, XML, and XSL to create an XSL 2.0 file to generate two meaningful HTML representations of your phonebook.
You're required to use a table for your objective—so you'll likely have to use the xsl:for-each construct.
You also need to demonstrate your knowledge of XPath and XSLT 2.0 features.
